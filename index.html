        Pamukkale, meaning "cotton castle" in Turkish, is a natural site in
        Denizli in southwestern Turkey. The area is famous for a carbonate
        mineral left by the flowing water. It is located in Turkey's Inner
        Aegean region, in the River Menderes valley, which has a temperate
        climate for most of the year. The ancient Greco-Roman city of Hierapolis
        was built on top of the white "castle" which is in total about 2,700
        metres (8,860 ft) long, 600 m (1,970 ft) wide and 160 m (525 ft) high.
        It can be seen from the hills on the opposite side of the valley in the
        town of Denizli, 20 km away

        Known as Pamukkale (Cotton Castle) or ancient Hierapolis (Holy City), this area has been drawing the weary to its thermal springs since the time of Classical antiquity. The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcium-rich springs. Dripping slowly down the vast mountainside, mineral-rich waters foam and collect in terraces, spilling over cascades of stalactites into milky pools below. Legend has it that the formations are solidified cotton (the area's principal crop) that giants left out to dry.

        There are only a few historical facts known about the origin of the
        city. No traces of the presence of Hittites or Persians have been found.
        The Phrygians built a temple, probably in the first half of the 7th
        century BC. This temple, originally used by the citizens of the nearby
        town of Laodicea, would later form the centre of Hierapolis. Coin of
        Eumenes II Hierapolis was founded as a thermal spa early in the 2nd
        century BC within the sphere of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus the Great
        sent 2,000 Jewish families to Lydia and Phrygia from Babylon and
        Mesopotamia, later joined by more from Judea. The Jewish congregation
        grew in Hierapolis and has been estimated as high as 50,000 in 62 BC.

        The Theatre was probably constructed under the reign of Hadrian after
        the earthquake of 60 AD.[11] The facade is 300 feet (91 m) long, the
        full extent of which remains standing. In the cavea there are 50 rows of
        seats divided into seven parts by eight intermediate stairways. The
        diazoma, which divided the cavea into two, was entered by two vaulted
        passages (the vomitoria). There is an Imperial loge at the middle of the
        cavea and a 6-foot-high (1.83 m) wall surrounding the orchestra.
